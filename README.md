This is the repo for *"Data Science in the tidyverse"* given at `rstudio::conf(2018)` in Jan 2018.

## Description

This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This workshop is designed for people who are familiar with R and want to learn how to achieve their data analysis goals the "tidy" way. You will learn how to visualize, transform, and model data in R and work with date-times, character strings, and untidy data formats. Along the way, you will learn and use many packages from the tidyverse including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.

## Software Requirements

You'll be using RStudio Cloud, so (all going well) on the day of the workshop all you'll need is a laptop that can access the internet (wifi will be available).  
However, as a backup (e.g. in case of wifi issues) it would be best if you also have R and RStudio installed locally, along with the following packages:

    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "fivethirtyeight",
      "babynames", "nycflights13", "gapminder"))

Don't forget to bring your power cable!
